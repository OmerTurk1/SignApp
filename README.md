# Experimental Mesaage Application
This is a Website Building Project where I learned building a website.

In this website; you can sign in, then log in on another time.
When you sign in first, it will send you a verification code, and you need to enter it to verify your account.
And when you want to log in later, you just need to enter your email and password.

In this project, i learned computing Html, Css, Javascript, Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript -> programming a basic website structure
Google Sheets -> Storing user data(using secure techniques)
Google Apps Script -> Deploying the website and managing our code in one hand
